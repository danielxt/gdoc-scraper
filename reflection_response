Female colleagues may feel unfairly treated in the workplace knowing that they are likely being paid less than their male counterparts even though they do the same work. They may be offered fewer professional opportunities than men, perhaps negatively impacting their social life.
Being open about pay in the workplace can put pressure on bosses to raise pay for female colleagues and reduce their implicit bias. Changing personal biases to understand that gender is irrelevant to quality of work can help create positive change in the workplace.
